\noindent\textbf{Question 1:}

Definitions in own words.
\noindent\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item \emph{State:} One possible situation in which an agent can be.
\item \emph{State Space:} The set of all States in a graph; with possible actions represented by edges connecting one state to the next state.
\item \emph{Search Tree:} A tree where the root node is the starting state and the leaf nodes are reachable states, connected by actions resulting in transition from the parent node to the child node.
\item \emph{Search Node:} A node in the search tree.
\item \emph{Goal:} The state which the agent is trying to arrive. 
\item \emph{Action:} Something the agent can do, that may or may not result in a change in state.
\item \emph{Successor Function:} A function which returns a set of resulting state - taken action pairs. Representing the outcome states of available actions.
\item \emph{Branching Factor:} The branching factor of a tree is the average number of children each non-leaf has.
\end{enumerate}
