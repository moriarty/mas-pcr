\noindent\textbf{Question 2:}


\noindent\emph{Explain why problem formulation must follow goal formulation:}


The goal formulation must occur before problem formulation to allow for efficient abstraction of the problem. If it is known what is required in the goal state, then unessential information need not be carried through the problem states. E.g. In defining a navigation for a road trip, states for driving with or without the radio on are not required; the radio (likely) has no effect the agent reaching its goal state.
