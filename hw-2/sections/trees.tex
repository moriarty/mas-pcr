\noindent\textbf{Question 3:}

\noindent\emph{Does a finite state space always lead to a finite search tree? How about a finite state space that is a tree? Can you be more precise about what types of state spaces always lead to finite search trees?}


A graph with loops, and a search algorithm which does not track if all edges from a node have been explored, could result in an infinite search space. With loop detection, and properly implemented search algorithms and tree data structures can detect and avoid this (pre[], post[]). Trees, or in general, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), will always lead to finite search trees.
